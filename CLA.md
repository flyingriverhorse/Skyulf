# Contributor License Agreement (short form)

By contributing to this repository you agree to the following short-form Contributor License Agreement (CLA):

1. You are the original author of the contribution or otherwise have the legal right to grant the below license.

2. You hereby grant the project maintainer(s) a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, sublicense, and otherwise exploit your contribution, and the right to grant sublicenses and to relicense the contribution as part of the project.

3. Your contributions are released under the project's license (GNU Affero General Public License v3.0). The project may relicense the code (or portions of the repository) under a different license in the future; by contributing you agree that your contribution may be included under such relicensing.

4. The project will preserve reasonable credit to contributors in project metadata such as the git history, AUTHORS file, or other attribution mechanisms where practical.

This CLA is intentionally short-form. It does not replace a detailed legal agreement. If you need a different contributor agreement, please contact the maintainers before submitting work.

If you do not agree with these terms, please do not submit a Pull Request; instead contact the maintainers to discuss alternative arrangements.
