# Skyulf 🐺

**Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) shouldn't be this hard.**

Skyulf is a self-hosted, privacy-first **MLOps Hub**. It is designed to be the "glue" that holds your data science workflow together—without the glue code. Bring your data, clean it visually, engineer features with a node-based canvas, and train models, all in one place.

Built with a modern stack: **FastAPI** (Backend), **React** (Frontend), **Celery** (Async Jobs), and **Redis**.

## Key Features

*   **🎨 Visual Feature Canvas**: A node-based editor to clean, transform, and engineer features without writing spaghetti code.
*   **🚀 Modern Backend**: Built on FastAPI for high performance and easy API extension.
*   **⚡ Async by Default**: Heavy training jobs run in the background via Celery & Redis (or background threads)—your UI never freezes.
*   **💾 Flexible Data**: Ingest CSV, Excel, JSON, Parquet, or SQL. Start with SQLite (zero-config) and scale to PostgreSQL.
*   **🧠 Model Training**: Built-in support for Scikit-Learn models with hyperparameter search (Grid/Random/Halving) and optional Optuna integration.
*   **📦 Model Registry & Deployment**: Version control your models, track metrics, and deploy them to a live inference API with a single click.

## Quick Start

### Installation

Prerequisites: **Python 3.10+**

```bash
pip install -r requirements-fastapi.txt
```

### Running the Server

```bash
python run_skyulf.py
```

The server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Running Without Celery (Direct Mode)

By default, Skyulf runs **without Celery** for simplicity. Background tasks execute directly in the FastAPI process using background threads. This is perfect for development and small-scale deployments.

To enable Celery for production workloads:

1. Set the environment variable:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   set USE_CELERY=true
   
   # Linux/Mac
   export USE_CELERY=true
   ```

2. Start Redis (required for Celery):
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine
   ```

3. Start the Celery worker:
   ```bash
   celery -A celery_worker worker --loglevel=info
   ```

4. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   python run_skyulf.py
   ```

> **Tip:** For local development, keep `USE_CELERY=false` (default) to avoid needing Redis.

## Documentation Structure

   *   **[Backend Python API Guide](python_api.md)**: Programmatic usage of backend modules (`core.*`).
   *   **[Data Ingestion](data/index.md)**: Connectors + profiling (`core.data_ingestion`).
   *   **[Architecture](architecture.md)**: System design and responsibilities.
*   **Skyulf Core (Library)**:

## Building & Deploying Documentation

This documentation is built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme, with auto-generated API docs via [mkdocstrings](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/).

### Local Development

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install mkdocs-material mkdocstrings[python]
   ```

2. **Serve locally with hot-reload:**
   ```bash
   mkdocs serve
   ```
   Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.

3. **Build static files:**
   ```bash
   mkdocs build
   ```
   This generates the `site/` directory with static HTML files.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

The documentation is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`, `master`, or `creatingnewversion` branches via GitHub Actions.

**Manual deployment:**
```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy --force
```

This pushes the built docs to the `gh-pages` branch and makes them available at:
`https://flyingriverhorse.github.io/Skyulf/site/`

### Accessing via index.html

Once deployed, the site is accessible through:
- **Landing Page**: `https://flyingriverhorse.github.io/Skyulf/` → Root `index.html`
- **Documentation**: `https://flyingriverhorse.github.io/Skyulf/site/` → MkDocs site

The `index.html` file is automatically generated by MkDocs and serves as the entry point. All navigation, search, and page routing work through this single-page application style setup.
