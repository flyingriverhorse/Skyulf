Skyulf Commercial License (Overview)

This project is dual-licensed:

- Open Source: GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later (AGPL-3.0-or-later)
- Commercial License: Available for organizations that cannot comply with the AGPL’s copyleft and network-use obligations

Summary (non-legal)

The AGPL remains the default license for all use. If you want to integrate Skyulf into a proprietary/closed-source product or service without the reciprocal obligations of the AGPL (including the network-use clause), you can obtain a separate commercial license from the copyright holder.

Key points of the commercial license (indicative only):

- Scope: Use, modify, and distribute Skyulf within closed-source applications or services without AGPL obligations.
- No copyleft: You are not required to release your application’s source code, even when offering it over a network.
- Compliance: You must comply with license terms, attribution, and any usage limits or seat/server terms specified in your commercial agreement.
- Support and warranty: Optional support, SLAs, and warranties can be included as part of a commercial agreement.
- Termination: Rights terminate if you breach the license terms and fail to cure within a defined period.

How to get a commercial license

- Create a GitHub Discussion or issue titled “Commercial License Request,” or
- Contact the project maintainer via the channels listed in the repository (e.g., README or project website).

We’ll follow up with next steps, including a short questionnaire about your use case and an appropriate license agreement.

Notes

- This file is an overview for convenience and is not a substitute for a signed commercial agreement.
- The AGPL-3.0-or-later license continues to apply unless and until a commercial license is executed.
- If you have already received a signed commercial agreement, its terms control your use.
