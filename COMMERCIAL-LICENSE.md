Skyulf Commercial Terms (Overview)

Skyulf is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. You may use it freely for open-source, commercial, on-prem, or hosted products without a separate copyleft exception.

When would you still contact us?

- **Enterprise support:** If you need SLAs, roadmap commitments, or long-term maintenance guarantees.
- **Custom licensing:** If your legal/compliance team requires bespoke terms (e.g., indemnification, audit clauses, or private amendments built on top of Apache-2.0).
- **Partnerships:** If you’d like co-marketing, joint roadmap planning, or early access to unreleased capabilities.

How to start the conversation

1. Open a GitHub Discussion or issue titled “Commercial Partnership Request,” or
2. Reach out via the contact channels listed in `README.md`.

Please share your intended use, deployment model, and any contractual requirements so we can scope the right agreement.

Notes

- Apache-2.0 remains the default license for all use unless a separate support/partnership contract is executed.
- Existing commercial agreements remain valid; if you want to migrate to Apache-only terms, contact us and we’ll coordinate.
- This page is informational and does not itself create any contractual rights.
