# Security Policy

## Supported versions
We maintain the latest main branch. Older tags may not receive patches.

## Reporting a vulnerability
- Please email a private report to the maintainers or use your preferred coordinated disclosure channel.
- Include reproduction steps, impact, and affected components.
- We aim to acknowledge within 3–5 business days.

## Dependencies
We rely on third-party packages (FastAPI, Celery, scikit-learn, Optuna, etc.). If the issue is upstream, please also report it to the upstream project.
